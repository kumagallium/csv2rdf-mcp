"""End-to-end validate against the committed starrydata-min fixture (CI gate).

This is the regression net for `csv2rdf-validate`: the fixture under
``tests/fixtures/starrydata_min/`` is a tiny, correct, starrydata-shaped bundle
that must pass all 8 traps. Running it in CI means any change that breaks a trap
checker - or the T1 ingester key recovery - fails the build, without needing the
full starrydata export or an API key.
